# Did you find a bug? (Bug Report)

We have a small amount of guidelines to make sure things go smoothly for all of us!

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, including (if possible) a screenshot and the expected behavior.
* Please use the existing bug report template found on our issue tracker!

# Do you have an enhancement/feature you want to suggest? (Feature Request)

We can't guarantee all requests will be possible or a high priority but we want to make this as good as possible so all requests are encouraged!

*Ensure the request is not already open by searching on Github under Issues
*Please use existing bug report template and include as much information as possible
*Pictures and/or step-by-step helps greatly

# Did you write a patch that fixes a bug? (Pull Request)

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Please only one pull request per bug/issue. Multiple "atomic" pulls are preferred to one large "nuclear" one.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please make sure code is readable, and commented where necessicary.

# Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch? (Make Prettier)

* Feel free to send this pull request if you have made your formatting standards and fixes clearly marked.
* These requests may be be denied if they do not add to the readabillity, functionality, or robustness of the code.

# Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one? (Write your own feature)

* Suggest your change in the Issues section and start writing code.
* Use issue tracker and communication tools to verify code and recieve feedback BEFORE submitting pull request

# Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

* Feel free to submit a pull request to any of our documentation, following our (Pull Request) guidelines as well as possible.
* Documentation is critical so recieve extra kudos from us!

Thanks for your interest! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
